# The Lost Pixel Art

An online multiplayer game developed during the online Global Game Jam 2021, using Unity 3D and the Mirror plugin. Either play as the guard and protect all the pixel paintings during a night shift in a gallery, or play as the robber and try to take all the gallery paintings. The paintings were all hand-made using the Pixel Art technique. All audio was also developed in-house.
